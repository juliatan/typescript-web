## How to set up

- `npm run start:parcel` starts the `parcel` server and `npm run start:json-server` runs the `json-server`.

## What this is about

- A practice project for me to practice Typescript by creating a web framework with Javascript.
- This framework uses `parcel` to enable us to compile Typescript easily and `json-server` to allow us to save data easily and access it with a REST API.
